# mywiimote
My Wiimote Library. 100% Java driver to communicate with WiiMote Controller of Wii Console.

In the past, there were some libraries to integrate java applications with wii remote control. However, libraries such as wiimoteJ, are no longer under maintenance.

This library was developed for fun purpose :-). There is no any kind of warranty.

Requirements: 

- BlueZ stack for Linux: http://www.bluez.org/. If you want to install BlueZ on Ubuntu distribution, see: https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/bluez/install-configure/install. 
- BlueCove Libray: your Java application must includes bluecove dependency.

If you want to see an example, look at the Sample.java.

It is easy to use. Try it!
